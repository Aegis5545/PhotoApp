## Version 1

In this first version of the program, I coded some basic starter ideas for my photo application.

## Photo Viewer

Here are the parts of how I got a 800x600 window to view photos:

- `UI`: I created a basic UI that includes scroll bars, and "zoom in" and "zoom out" buttons. I also created a file menu where you can find and open your images too.
- `Zoom in/out`: I also created a feature where you can zoom in and zoom out of your designated photo with either your scroll button on your mouse, or zoom in/zoom out buttons in the UI.

>## How does the zoom feature work?

> The zoom feature works by taking your original image and multiplying it by the zoom factor (input generated by buttons/scroll wheel and multiplying/dividing based on zooming in/out based on said input value by 1.2) created by your scroll wheel/button input. Then, it sets the current image to the new, zoomed in image.
