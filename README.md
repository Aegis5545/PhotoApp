# PhotoApp
A finished photo application

This was pretty much my first standalone project that I got done! It might be a bit bare bones, but I'm glad that everythings working
and that this was one of my first, more complex successful projects!

I plan on working on more projects in the future, I may or may not come back to this project if I want to experiment more with
editing photos/GUI with Java Swift.
